# Core numerical functions for Toblerone 

# This module contains the key functions that operate on patches of surface (see
# classes module) to estimate the fraction of a voxel enclosed within said patch.
# The most computationally intensive methods are handled by Cython in the module 
# ctoblerone (see extern/ctoblerone.pyx). Finally, certain functions that are re-
# used between modules are defined in pvcore. 

# This module should not be directly interacted with: the modules estimators and 
# pvtools provide outward-facing wrappers for actual PV estimation.

            # caps, 3 almost rectangular side faces that are further split into 2
            # triangles each). Splitting the quadrilateral faces into triangles is 
            # the tricky bit as it can be done in two ways, as below.

            # It is important to ensure that neighbouring prisms share the same 
            # subdivision of their adjacent faces (ie, both of them agree to split
            # it in the \ or / direction) to avoid double counting regions of space.
            # This is achieved by enumerating the triangular faces of the prism in 
            # a specific order according to the index numbers of the triangle 
            # vertices. For each vertex n, if the index number of vertex n+1 (with
            # wraparound for the last vertex) is greater, then we split the face
            # that the edge (n, n+1) belongs to in a "positive" manner. Otherwise, 
            # we split the face in a "negative" manner. A positive split means that 
            # a diagonal will go from the pial vertex N to white vertex n+1. A
            # negative split will go from pial vertex N+1 to white vertex n. As a
            # result, around the complete prism formed by the two triangles, there
            # will be two face diagonals that ALWAYS meet at the WHITE vertex
            # with the HIGHEST index number (referred to as 'a'). With these two 
            # diagonals fixed, the order of the last diagonal depends on the 
            # condition B < C (+ve) or C < B (-ve). We check this using the 
            # flagsum variable, which will be 2 for B < C or 1 for C < B. Finally,
            # knowing how the last diagonal is arranged, there are exactly two 
            # ways of splitting the prism down, hardcoded at the top of this file.
