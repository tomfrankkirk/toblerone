Projection 
=============

Toblerone provides functions for projecting data between volumetric and surface-based representations. These have been developed for use in neuroimaging, and hence are intimately related to the *partial volume effect* that is the other main focus of this module. 

Within the context of imaging on the cortex, the region of interest is a narrow ribbon that is bounded by the pial (outer) and white (inner) surfaces of the brain.
